Project Description
This project lets you blow out a virtual candle on your computer screen just by blowing into your microphone. It uses real-time audio analysis to detect when a strong puff of air hits the mic, and then turns off the flame — only to magically relight itself after a few seconds.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People love blowing out candles on birthdays, but what about when you’re stuck in an online meeting, bored, and have no cake around? The emotional damage of not having a candle to blow out is severe and grossly overlooked in modern society.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We’ve created a browser-based candle that listens to you. Blow hard enough into your mic, and it turns off. No calories, no wax mess, no smoke alarms , just pure useless satisfaction.
